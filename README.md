No need to merge this to any branch yet. `git clone -b <branch> <repo>` to clone the branch in a different folder in your local machine. Alternatively, do a git pull from master then checkout this branch WITHOUT using the "git checkout -b" command. Git will automatically generate a branch with this branch's name on your machine and track it from origin.
